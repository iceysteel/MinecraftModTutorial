                <br><br><br>
				Okay, lets get started learning to mod!
                <br><br>
                Here we have our blank Block class. We need to create a constructor, so that Minecraft knows what to do when we craft this block. To do this we will create a constructor. A constructor describes what to do every time our block is created in the game. In the constructor we will describe the basics details of the trampoline block.
				<br><br>
				We can do this by creating a constructor.<br>
                <center><b>public TrampolineBlock(){}</b></center>
				<br><br>
				<div class="card">

                    Delete the code from before and
                    <p>
                    try making your computer print something!<br><br>
                    type <br>
                        <b>public TrampolineBlock(){}</b>
                    <br>
                    </p>


                </div>
		</div>

            <div class = "dir">
			<p class="step">2 - Defining a Constructor </p>
			<button class="next" type="button" onclick="next(3)">Next</button>
			<button class="previous" onclick="previous(3)">Prev.</button>
			<br><br><br>
                First, we’ll inherit the qualities of an existing block. There is no need to make a completely new set of rules, so we will use the rules from another block, specifically from sand. We’re using sand, because it’s easy to break with just your hands. To do this we must call the constructor of the generic block to use the sand material.
                <br>
                <center><b>super(Material.sand);</b></center>
                <br>
                Next we have to add our block to the GameRegistry. The GameRegistry organizes all of the blocks in the game and makes sure that each block has a different name. To register the game we will call the registerBlock function.
                <br>
                <br>
                <center><b>GameRegistry.registerBlock(this, name);</b></center>
                <div class="card">
                    1. Add all of these lines to your constructor:
                    <br>
                    		super(Material.sand);<br>
		GameRegistry.registerBlock(this, name);<br>
                </div>
							</div>
                <div class = "dir">
			<p class = "step">3 - Finishing the Constructor</p>
			<button class="next" type="button" onclick="next(4)">Next</button>
			<button class="previous" onclick="previous(4)">Prev.</button>
                <br><br><br>
								<br>
								You probably noticed that there is two different arguments inside the parentheses: this and name. <i>this</i> tells the GameRegistry that we are registering the block we are currently constructing, the trampoline. If you look above the constructor, you can see we declared a variable with the name TrampolineBlock.<i>name</i> gives the GameRegistry the name we want to use for the block.
								<br>
Also, we need to set the name of the block for the other parts of the game. To do that we just need this one line:
								<br>
								<br>
								<center><b>setUnlocalizedName(name);</b></center>
								<br>
								<br>
								Finally we will tell Minecraft where our block belongs in creative mod. You’ve probably noticed that there are different tabs in your creative inventory that make it easy to find the item or block you want. Since our trampoline is a block, we will put it in the block category.
								<br>
								<br>
								<center><b>setCreativeTab(CreativeTabs.tabBlock);</b></center>
								<br><div class="card">
                    <p>!. Add these lines to your constructor.
										setUnlocalizedName(name);<br>
										setCreativeTab(CreativeTabs.tabBlock);<br>
                    <br>
                    </p>
                </div>
		</div>

<!--Switch from Block class to Mod class.-->
			<div class = "dir">
				<p class="step">4 - Connecting the Block and Mod</p>
				<button class="next" onclick="next(5)">Next</button>
				<button class="previous" onclick="previous(5)">Prev.</button>
				<br> <br><br>
               Now we're going to work on the main mod class.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our block has been created, but Minecraft does not know our block exists! As a result, we need to create a mod class to get the game’s attention. The Mod class’s purpose is to tell Minecraft about all the items and blocks in our mod and how to access those things. As you can see, there are already two functions in the file: preinit and init.
                <br><br>
                Before the Minecraft world loads up, we need to tell the game what our mod includes. That is what the the preinit function does; it tells Minecraft what blocks and items we are adding and puts them in the GameRegistry. In our preinit, we only need one line, because we only have one block. This line will create an instance of our block.
                <br><br>
                <center><b>trampolineBlock = new TrampolineBlock();</b></center>
                <br><br>
                <div class="card">
                    Add this line to the preinit() function.<br>
                    trampolineBlock = new TrampolineBlock();
                </div>
			</div>

			<div class = "dir">
				<p class="step">5 - Recipe Components</p>
				<button class="next" onclick="next(6)">Next</button>
				<button class="previous" onclick="previous(6)">Prev.</button>
				<br><br><br>
                Next we have the init function. This is where the mod is set-up and where we will describe the recipe to create the trampoline block. First we need to define what will be created with this recipe. Obvioiusly we want to create the trampoline block.
<br><br>
<center><b>ItemStack i = new ItemStack(trampolineBlock)</b></center>
<br><br>
                Next, we need to describe the recipe. Those of you who have played Minecraft before know that the crafting table provides a 3 by 3 grid of squares to place ingredients in. We will define our recipe in as if it were a 3 by 3 grid.
<br><br>

                <div class="card">
                    1. Create an ItemStack<br>
                    ItemStack i = new ItemStack(trampolineBlock)<br>
                </div>

            </div>
						<div class = "dir">
							<p class="step">6 - Creating the Recipe </p>
							<button class="next" onclick="next(7)">Next</button>
							<button class="previous" onclick="previous(7)">Prev.</button>
							<br><br><br>
			 <center><b>Object recipe = new Object[]{<br>
			“PPP”,<br>
			“PWP”,<br>
			“PPP”,<br>
			}
			</b></center>
			<br>
			Notice I split up the recipe onto different lines, so it is easier to recognize as a 3 by 3 grid. Instead of writing out the name of each item, we are using the letters P and W to stand for wooden planks and wool, respectively. So our recipe stands for a block of wool, surrounded by wooden planks. Now that you understand that, we must tell Minecraft what our letters mean. These two elements go in the Object array after the last comma.
			<br><br>
			<center><b>'P', Blocks.planks, ‘W’, Blocks.wool</b></center>
			<br><br>
			                <div class="card">
			                    1. Your recipe Object Array should look like this:<br>
			                    Object recipe = new Object[]{<br>
			“PPP”,<br>
			“PWP”,<br>
			“PPP”,<br>
			'P', Blocks.planks, 'W', Blocks.wool<br>
			}
			                </div>

			            </div>
<div class = "dir">
				<p class="step">7 - Finalizing the Recipe</p>
				<button class="next" onclick="next(8)">Next</button>
				<button class="previous" onclick="previous(8)">Prev.</button>
				<br><br><br>
          Finally, we need to put the result and the recipe together and register them. Like before where we registered to block with the GameRegistry, we need to register our recipe with the GameRegistry using the ItemStack and Object array we just created.
<br><br>
<center><b>GameRegistry.addRecipe(i, recipe);</b></center>
<br><br>
That’s it! Our recipe is done!
                <div class="card">
                1.Register the recipe:<br>
                    GameRegistry.addRecipe(i, recipe);<br>

                </div>

            </div>
            <div class = "dir">
				<p class="step">8 - Bounciness</p>
				<button class="next" onclick="next(9)">Next</button>
				<button class="previous" onclick="previous(9)">Prev.</button>
				<br><br><br>
                We have defined our block, added it to a mod, and created the recipe. Now to finish it off, we need to make it bouncy. On a trampoline, you can only bounce if you jump on it. So we need to call a function that will make the character bounce if you jump on it. The function we need is called <i>onFallenUpon</i>.<br><br>
                We can create the function with this line of code:<br><br>
                <center><b>public void onFallenUpon(World world, BlockPos bp,  Entity entity, float f){}</b></center>
                <br><br>
                There are a lot of arguments there, but we only are worried about the entity. entity refers to any living thing that jumps on our trampoline block.
                <br><br>
                <div class="card">
                1.Add the function <i>onFallenUpon</i>:<br>
                    public void onFallenUpon(World world, BlockPos bp,  Entity entity, float f){}<br>
                </div>

            </div>
						<div class = "dir">
				<p class="step">9 - Bounciness Continued!</p>
				<button class="next" onclick="next(10)">Next</button>
				<button class="previous" onclick="previous(10)">Prev.</button>
				<br><br><br>
								To move the player, we will tell the entity to move itself using its moveEntity function. So inside the function's brackets, add this line.
<br><br>
<center><b>entity.moveEntity(entity.serverPosX, entity.serverPosY+5, entity.serverPosZ);</b></center>
<br><br>
As you can see, we refer to the entity many times in that line. we don’t want to move the player horizontally, so we do not change its server position on the x or z axes. The y-position or its vertical position is what we want to change, so we add five to its current position.
								<br><br>
								<div class="card">
										2.Call the <i>moveEntity</i> function from that function:<br>
										entity.moveEntity(entity.serverPosX, entity.serverPosY+5, entity.serverPosZ);<br>

								</div>

						</div>
