				Okay, lets get started learing Python!
                <br><br>
                First we're going to start off by doing something all programmers do when they first learn a computer language: display the words
                "Hello world".
				<br><br>
				in Python we can do this by typing <br>
                <center><b>print("Hello World")</b></center>
                Python understands whats in between the quotes as text and then print() tells it to 
				<br><br>
				<div class="card">
                    
                    delete the code from before and
                    <p>
                    try making your computer print something!<br><br>
                    type <b>print(" ")</b> and write hello world in between the quotes (or what you want the computer to say).
                    </p>
                    <br> then click the green button to run your code.

                     to use a varible's value you say it's name
                    </center>
                    <div id = "instructionpic" style="padding:5px">
                        
                        <b>print(sometext)</b>
                        <br>#this will print out "this will be stored"
                        <br>#you can even try it by copying these lines into the editor
                    </div>
                    <br>
                </div>
                    There are 2 types of variables you will be using <ul>
                        <li>Strings<ul>
                            <li>These are words or strings of characters</li>
                            <li>Strings are constructed using quotation marks in the value (ex. "Hello World!")</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li>Booleans<ul>
                            <li>These are special keywords that can be either <b>True</b> or <b>False</b></li>
                            <li>don't worry about these kind of varibles for now we will go over them later</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    </ul>

                Every command must be ended by pressing enter and going to the next line, which means that if you make a variable,
                modify a variable, execute a function, and many more, you must press enter to go to the next line.
                </div>
                <br>
                <div class="card">
                    1. make a varible called <b>mytext</b> and store any piece of text in it.<br>
                    2. print it out using the <b>print()</b> command.
                </div>

			<div class = "dir">
				<p class="step">3 - Input</p>
				<button class="next" onclick="next(4)">Next</button>
				<button class="previous" onclick="previous(4)">Prev.</button>
				<br> <br><br>
                Next we're going to learn how to get input from the user(the user is the person running our program).
                <br><br>
                to use take input we write <b>raw_input()</b> .<br>
                If you want to prompt the user with a specific piece of text put the string in between the parenthesis like so:<br> 
                <b>raw_input("say something")</b>
                <br><br>
                you can store the input into a varible using the <b>=</b> sign.
                <br> in Python you want to think of the <b>=</b> sign as an arrow pointing left &lt;= because what is on the right is being put into what is on the left.
                
                <br><br>
                <div class="card">
                    Try using <b>raw_input()</b> and a varible to store the value of what the user has entered. Then use <b>print()</b>
                    to display it again on the output.
                </div>

				<button class="next" onclick="next(5)">Next</button>

				<br><br><br>
                Okay, its finally time to get started on our game!<br><br>
                The first thing our game needs to do is to tell the player what is going on in the game world.
                We will do this by printing three different things. Next we'll use what we've learned about raw_input
                to ask the player what the first thing they want to do is.
                <br><br>
                <center><b>feel free to go back to previous steps if you forgot something, your code won't change between steps.</b></center>
                <br><br>
                
                <div class="card">
                    1. use <b>print()</b> to output these three pieces of text:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You are in a village.</li>
                        <li>A dragon is attacking.</li>
                        <li>Will you fight the dragon?</li>
                    </ul>
                    2. make a varible called <b>response</b> and use <b>raw_input()</b> and <b>=</b> to store value in. Also make <b>raw_input()</b>
                    ask the user to <b>"enter y/n: "</b> to choose wheather or not to fight the dragon.
                </div>
                
            </div>

            <div class = "dir">
				<p class="step">5 - True or False</p>
				<button class="next" onclick="next(6)">Next</button>
				<button class="previous" onclick="previous(6)">Prev.</button>
				<br><br><br>
                So now that we have the player telling us what they want to do, how do we make our code react to that and change what it does based on 
                what the player chooses?
                <br><br>                
                first we need to find out weather or not the player entered "y" or "n". We are going to check this by finding out
                wheather or not the response is equal to "y" or "n". 
                <br><br>
                To check wheather something is equal to something in python we put <b>==</b> in between them. 
                <center><b> 10*10 == 100 </b>#this becomes <b>True</b></center>
                 <center><b> 1+1 == 3 </b>#this becomes <b>False</b></center>
                If they are equal the computer
                just replaces the whole thing with a <b>True</b> while the program is running or <b>False</b> if it isn't equal.
                <br><br>
                <div class="card">
                Use the varible from the last step, <b>response</b> and <b>print()</b> weather or not it is equal to <b>"y"</b>
                <br><br>
                    hint: you can put the response == "y" inside the parenthesis of <b>print()</b>
                </div>
                
            </div>

				Okay let's get started making our game now that we know all about loops and conditional statements. You can clear the code editor for now.
				<br><br>
                First lets go over the structure of our game, which will look something like this:
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>while loop that checks if game is over<ul>
						<li>ask user if they want to fight a dragon<ul>
							<li>if they say yes and dont have a sword<ul>
								<li>lose</li></ul>
                            </li>
                             <li>if they say no</li>
                                <ul><li>ask them if they want to go left or right</li>
                                <ul><li>if they want to go left take them to the beginning</li>
                                    <li>if they choose right give them a sword and go back to beginning </li>
                                    
                                    </ul>
                                    </ul>
                            <li>if they say yes and have a sword</li>
                            <ul><li>win!</li></ul>
						</ul></li>
					</ul></li>
				</ul>
                <div class="card">Thats quite a lot to do! But don't worry we'll break it up into easier chunks for you.<br><br>
                lets start by creating the varibles <b>playagain</b> which will start off <b>True</b> and <b>sword</b> which will start off 
                <b>False</b>. Lets also make a print statement that prints out <b>"You are the great hero, Zain."</b> you can replace Zain with your name.
                Finally make a <b>while():</b> loop and put <b>playagain</b> in the parenthesis. This will be our game's main loop.</div>

			<!--Below is where user gets Snake code and learns how to save code-->

			<div class = "dir">
				<p class="step">12 - First if</p>
				<button class="next" onclick="next(13)">Next</button>
				<button class="previous" onclick="previous(13)">Prev.</button>
				<br><br><br>
                Next up we want to make the games intro and first decision. 
                Start by copying the three lines below inside the while loop from the last step.
				<br><pre>
print("You are in a village.")
print("A dragon is attacking.")
print("Will you fight the dragon?")
                </pre>
                <div class="card">Make a varible <b>response</b> and store the value of<b>raw_input()</b>
                put <b>"y/n :"</b> in between the parenthesis of raw_input to display it to the player
                <br><br>
                    Next write a conditional statement to check how the player responded as well as
                    wheather or not they have a sword.                    
                    using <b> if(): elif():</b>  and<b> else:</b> leave the insides of each statement blank for now we'll do that in the next step
                <br><br> Hint: the if statement will be checking <b>response == "y" and sword == False</b>
                </div>
                <br>

			</div>


			<!--End copying code/final introduction-->


			<!--Begin actual Snake coding-->

			<div class = "dir">
				<p class="step">13 - Consiquences</p>
				<button class="next" onclick="next(14)">Next</button>
				<button class="previous" onclick="previous(14)">Prev.</button>
				<br><br><br>
                In this step you will write the consiquences of each desicision the player makes.
                <br> If the player choose to fight the dragon and they don't have a sword to fight with
                they will lose and we want the following code to run:
                <pre>print("You tried to fight a dragon without a sword.")
print("That was a bad choice, you lose.")
playagain = False</pre>

                However, if the player does have a sword and chooses "y" we want the following to run:
                <pre>print("You have defeated the dragon!")
print("You really are the great hero Zain.")
print("You win!")
playagain = False</pre>
                Again, you can replace Zain with your name.
                <br><br>
                <div class="card">
                    Take a moment to understand and copy the code above into the right place in
                    your program.
                    <br><br>
                    next step we'll be filling up that <b>else:</b> condition so it's okay for that to be blank for now
                </div>
			</div>

			<div class = "dir">
				<p class="step">13 - Or Else!</p>
				<button class="next" onclick="next(15)">Finish!</button>
				<button class="previous" onclick="previous(15)">Prev.</button>
				<br><br><br>
                The last thing we need to do now is to write the part of the game where
                our player can find the sword they need to fight the dragon and win!
                <br><br>
                Lets start by letting the player know that they can choose to go left or right. 
                We'll do this by writing the following lines after the <b>else:</b> conditional.
                <pre>print("There are two paths. Go (L)eft or (R)ight?")
response = raw_input()</pre>
                Now we just need to check which way the player chose and decide wheather or not to
                give them the sword.
                <br><br>
                
                <div class="card">
                Start by writing the two lines of code from above after the <b>else:</b> conditional.
                Next you need to check if the user entered <b>"L"</b> or <b>"R"</b> if they entered 
                <b>"L"</b> then make them go back to the beginning. <br> because you are in a while loop you can do this by just using
                <b>print() </b> with the strings <b> "You walk and..." </b> and <b>"You end up at the beginning of the story."</b>
                <br><br>
                Finally if the player entered "R", or basically went right. <b>print()</b> that they found the sword
                and then change the value of <b>sword</b> to be <b>True</b>. After that you are done!
                </div>
                
			</div>

				    Congratulations on finishing your Adventure Game!
					<br><br>
					 We recommend you saving your code to a text file on your computer so that you can copy and play it later if you want (it will go away once you close the browser)
					<br><br>
					Great job on finishing your Hour of Code project! We hope you had a great time and at the same time learned a lot about programming in Python. Thank you for learning with us for an hour and we hope to see you next year!
                    <br><br>
                If you would like to learn more about how to code the other parts of the game that you did not do in this session, feel free to contact knodemy at <a target = "_blank" href="knodemy.com">our website</a>, and we will give you lessons on more advanced coding.
